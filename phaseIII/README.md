In phase 3 we focused almost entirely on our User Tests. These were used to determine how actual users would approach certain tasks in the app.

### Methods

The methods we used were just User Tests. These tests consisted of 5 participants, that needed to complete 3 tasks assigned to them. The tasks were to, one, find and go to a fan sounds video. Second, find and use the Timer and Autoplay features. Then last, upload a video to the app. The participants were asked to speak aloud during their thinking to allow us to hear what went through their heads. 

### Findings

We found that a majority of participants had trouble with the first task. They either did not use the tags page, or did use it, but didn't use the hamburger icon. However once the first task was complete. Almost every participant was able to easily complete the last two. Suprisingly the "User" Icon, was significantly more salient than the hamburger one. Which we were not expecting. Other than that, we just found that we needed for fidelity in our prototype. As most participants tried using the search button, or tried clicking on the different times in the Timer. Both features that we did not feel at the time were necassary to flesh out.
