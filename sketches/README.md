# Sketches
#### Our sketches were basic drawings of what we thought the app could look like. Showing some different screens, and the general layout of the app.

In this I went for two different designs to test out what they would look like to to eye intially. We found that having a tags page was the way to go, but in Derek's I believe he captured a better looking one. Have the search bar at the bottom I felt was important, after it had been brought up that for mobile users, its the most convenient spot.

My thought main thought was to have two seperate feeds, home(left) and tags(right). Home would mainly expose the user to tags that they've selected while also displaying other video suggestions based on videos they've watched tags. The tag feed would only show the user videos with tags they've explicitly selected while allowing them to edit what tags should be currently be displayed. The last important aspect is having the search option on the bottom of the page, I find it annoying when apps have search at the top while using my phone one handed.
