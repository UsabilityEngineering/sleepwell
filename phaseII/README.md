In phase 2 we focused on taking our initial findings and using them to develop clear ideas on how the project should be structured, and how it should function. We used further analysis in this phase to then refine those ideas into tangible wireframes to actually show the project as a whole. 

### Methods

The methods used in this phase were more inherent to the actually functionality and design of the project than the ones used in the first. They were used for finding out exactly how the project should work, and each looked at it from a different view.

**Wireframes** -- Wireframes are basically an outline of the project. They show each and every screen that the end user could go to, and a little of the functionality of said screen. These allowed us to focus on the overall project as a whole, in order to then in other methods go step by step through each screen as the user would. 

**Cognitive Walkthroughs** -- Cognitive walkthroughs are were you go step by step through using the app, with a goal in mind. Usually you are doing this through the persepective of a persona. These are good for finding out if your project has any holes, or inconsistancies. They also allow for insight throught the eyes of the user, to see if the usability is at a sufficient level. For this phase, the Cognitive Walkthrough was done by fellow classmates on our project. 


### Findings

This phase we are honing in on what the project should act and feel like. During the creation of our __*Wireframes*__ we found that there were a lot of features that we either had not thought about, or didn't know how to do. This led to us have deeper discussions on where the path of this project is leading us. We decided that having our app be one where we create the videos at first would work better. Then later on we can move into hiring creators to make content for the app. This change affected our Wireframes, and through this change we found more areas that we improved.

On the __*Cognitive Walkthroughs*__ done for our project, the participants found that the app did seem effective to navigate through. Though there was need to organize our Wireframes better, as the salience of what the next screen should be was not quite sufficient. Another point we took from the Walkthroughs, was that we need to further develop our Personas and Scenarios. As most of our Persona's goals were very similar, most of the feedback we attained from the Walkthroughs was similar as well. So creating Personas with more distinct and specific goals and scenarios, would greatly benefit us.
