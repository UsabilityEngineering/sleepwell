Chris is an avid ASMR listener as he has trouble sleeping, usually finding his brain running at full speed even though his brain doesn’t agree. He tends to move through relaxation apps continuously saying, “They never really fill the exact role I need, so I only keep them for around a day or two.” Due to his poor sleeping, he tends to toss and turn at night, disturbing his wifes sleep.
Chris’s Goals:
Get a full night's rest to feel rejuvenated for work
Stop tossing and turning at night
Start lucid dreaming as he read about how good it can be online for getting work done during sleep

Jeremy:
19 year old College Student at Yale University
	
	Jeremy is a typical college student, whose parents are strongly pushing him towards a degree in law. He is usually having to put in more effort than his peers, as he was not born very studious. Due to this, he is constantly under stress and harassment from his parents to perform. 
	His reprieve at the end of the day is 2 hours he gives himself to unwind, and he has been trying different methods to do so. He's tried sensory deprivation, meditation, and other forms of relaxation. 

Goals:
Live up to his parents expectations
Not stress about school while trying to sleep

# Scenarios

Chris gets home, exhausted as always. He jumps in bed as he reads that being on a schedule can help with lucid dreaming. He turns on the current relaxation app has been using, once again annoyed that the interface is so hard to navigate. He always has to spend at least an hour finding a good video to listen to, and all that screen time causes even more trouble sleeping. He'd really like an app that is easy to navigate, and isn't riddled with videos that don’t help him at all.

Mari worked a 4 hour shift, got off at 6:00 pm and her kids were out with friends so she heated up the leftover lasagna and poured herself a few too many glasses of pinot noir while watching love island. She lays down, but can’t stop thinking about where her life has gone. She really wants a healthy distraction that will help her relax and get to sleep without these thoughts.

Jeremy is laying in bed, stressing over an upcoming test in 3 days. None of his usual methods are working, and he really needs this time to unwind or he might explode. He would really like something he could just open up, that did the thinking for him on how to destress.
