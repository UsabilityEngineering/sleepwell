# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Sleep Well as an app is being designed to curate relaxing videos for users that wish to listen/watch them. In this first sprint we accomplished:

- **A Competitive Analysis**
  - In this we found our main competitor to be Youtube, this finding led to our further findings in the Heuristic evaluation.
  - We also found that one main thing we could have over them is a more narrowed in list of videos to fulfill the users needs.
- **A Heuristic Evaluation**
  - In this we found that Youtube was most likely going to be overtaken by our app, but that it had certain flaws such as the position of the search bar that we could do better in our app.
- **Personas and Scenarios**
  - These **highlight what our users want** and how they would most likely achieve those goals using our app.
  - We also found during this that relaxation would probably be our main focus.
- **Sketches**
  - Lastly our sketches provided ideas on how to put the app together, where things belong and why they belong there. We found that a **tags page** would be the best solution, allowing the user to choose their tags for videos to search.

Overall this first sprint gave us good direction on where to go with the app for the next ones, we got a good analysis on what the users want and need, though further testing with actual users will be necessary.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

In this phase we created Wireframes, to map out the functionality of  SleepWell, and had external evaluators analyze the wireframes through Cognitive Walkthroughs. These provided a more clear idea of the strengths and weaknesses in our wireframes. 

- The Cognitive Walkthroughs provided by external evaluators revealed an issue that our Personas and Scenarios had, in which more variety in their goals are needed. 
  - Such as a content creator **uploading a video**

- Last, we found that using videos from Youtube was **not sustainable**. Consequently, Sleepwell will allow **user created content**.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

This phase was mainly focused on our User Tests. Our test had participants run through 3 tasks that assessed how they completed each one. We found that there was some confusion in using the tags page, and that most people tried using the search ability, even though it was not implemented into the actual prototype. From these tests we believe we had two main takeaways.
- First, we need to redo the button that lets you search by tags. The hamburger style icon we used just wasn't salient enough for users to understand its use.
- Last is that a higher fidelity prototype would've alleviated multiple of the problems participants had with it.
